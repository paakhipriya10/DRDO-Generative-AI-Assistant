Title: DRDO Labs and Ongoing Projects

The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) operates through a network of over 40 laboratories, each dedicated to a specific domain of military technology. These include aeronautics, missiles, electronics, armaments, naval systems, life sciences, and advanced computing.

Key labs include:

1. **DRDL (Defence Research and Development Laboratory)** – Works on missile systems.
2. **ADE (Aeronautical Development Establishment)** – Designs UAVs and flight systems.
3. **DLRL (Defence Electronics Research Lab)** – Develops electronic warfare technologies.
4. **SSPL (Solid State Physics Laboratory)** – Specializes in semiconductors and materials.
5. **INMAS (Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences)** – Focuses on life sciences and medical countermeasures.
6. **CAIR (Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics)** – Develops AI tools for battlefield scenarios.
7. **GTRE (Gas Turbine Research Establishment)** – Works on indigenous jet engines.

Recent Projects:

- **UAV Rustom-II**: Medium-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle.
- **AURA UCAV**: A stealthy unmanned combat aerial vehicle under advanced development.
- **Light Combat Aircraft (Tejas)**: Indigenous multi-role fighter aircraft already deployed.
- **Netra AEW&CS**: Airborne early warning and control systems developed for the Indian Air Force.
- **Arjun MBT**: Main battle tank designed for desert warfare, now under Mk1A upgrades.
- **Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle (HSTDV)**: A step toward hypersonic missile systems.
- **SAMAR air defense system**: A mobile air defense platform.

In addition to the laboratories, DRDO supports the DRDO Young Scientist Laboratories (DYSLs), which foster innovation in artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, cognitive technologies, and smart materials.

Each lab follows a multi-tier project execution model, often collaborating with industry partners and academic institutions under initiatives like Technology Development Fund (TDF) and Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX).

The organization’s future roadmap includes quantum radar, directed-energy weapons, space-based surveillance, and integrated electronic warfare systems.

DRDO’s motto, “Balasya Mulam Vigyanam,” highlights science as the foundation of strength. Its mission is to build a self-reliant India with cutting-edge indigenous defense capabilities.
